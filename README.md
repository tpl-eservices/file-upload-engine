# Installation Instructions:

`cd file-upload-engine`     
`bundle install`      
`rails db:setup`     
`rails s`     

# Optional:
You need to install imagemagick if it's not already on your system (which is used to resize any uploaded images)
`brew install imagemagick`

# Logging in on local development:

As there is not an smtp server set up for local development, when you first sign up it won't send an email with the confirmation link. Instead, you can find the link in the server logs. Simply copy and paste the link into a browser and this will confirm your email address.

# Updating credentials:

As you don't want to be commiting access keys, logins, or generally anything you would want to remain a secret, you should be modifying the encrypted credentials.yml.enc file. To modify this file, type the below:
`EDITOR="subl --wait" rails credentials:edit`     

When you are finished, simply close the file and it will be encrypted again.

# Postgres troubleshooting:

If you are on a mac, installing postgres should be relatively easy. If postgres does not successfully install through the bundle command, you can use:     
`brew install postgres`

On linux, the process is a bit more involved:     
`sudo apt-get install postgresql`

Starting the server on linux:     
`pg_ctl -D /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/var/postgres start`
